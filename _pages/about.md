I am a passionate of the diversity of natural landscapes and systems. Originally from Peru, my professional experience provided me with a broader perspective when studying natural ecosystems. My research endeavors aim not only seeking solutions to environmental challenges, such as human activity and global change, but also studying the knowledge behind these ecological processes. 
Besides my academic journey, I work as an environmental consultant on projects related to the Andes-Amazon region in the private and non-profit sectors. I have participated in grant writing of research projects in Peru and coordinated outreach activities such as participatory monitoring, citizen science, and the design and layout of project products for different audiences. 

Research Work
======
My research integrates remote sensing, GIS, and quantitative modeling to investigate ecosystems and their responses to natural and anthropogenic pressures. For instance, I have examined trophic structure and food web dynamics in Green Bay’s coastal wetlands, focusing on how habitat setting shapes fish communities ecology. In the Western Amazon, I have characterized hydrogeomorphological connectivity in the Pacaya Samiria wetland, linking water fluxes, geomorphic units, and habitat formation to the spatial distribution of aquatic communities. Additionally, I have assessed the impacts of human activities on ecosystem services in the Eten coastal wetland in Peru, combining GIS and field data to map landscapes, quantify ecosystem services, and evaluate threats using a DSPIR (Drivers, Pressures, States, Impacts, Responses) framework. Currently, I am working on how mining impacts biodiversity through diverse pathways at different spatial and temporal scales, and the effectiveness of restoration practice. My doctoral dissertation focuses on understanding how extractive industries reshape ecosystems and alter species’ spatial dynamics, emphasizing how structural habitat degradation constrains biodiversity and how restoration must be tailored to improve habitat quality.

Values
======
These experiences made me an advocate for gender equality and science communication, aiming to support science-based evidence for policy-making and conservation. I also believe that diversity, not limited to gender, ethnicity, and religion, is key to both conducting better science and properly communicating it to society.
